====== SIP End2End Connector Project ======
SIP End2End Connector is intended to be used as a [[gateway:gatewayagent|Gateway Agent]] connector app. It extends AllJoyn as a proximal protocol to be able to interact with the external network, including the far-end AllJoyn devices and Cloud Apps. It establishes a standard end-to-end mechanism for secure interoperations and interconnections across WANs.

===== Main Features =====

  * End-to-end interoperations in a standard and transparent way over  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol|SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)]]
  * Third party applications/extensions with standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol|SIP]] application servers
  * [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3856.txt|Presence]]/Notification/Messages/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service|QoS]]/[[http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aaa/documents/|AAA]] support out of box
  * Standard and open [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol|SIP]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem|IMS]] network framework
  * Cloud platform based on Node.js will be available very soon (hosted by   [[http://www.smartconn.cc|SmartConn]])

==== Original Project Proposal ====

To build and run the SIP E2E connector, please refer to [[Get Started]]. Currently we support the 32-bit build on Windows and the 32-bit/64-bit build on Ubuntu. The SIP E2E connector now runs as a standalone program and we are modifying the connector such that it will work with the gateway agent.

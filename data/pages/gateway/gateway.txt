====== Gateway Working Group ======

===== Mission =====

The mission of the Gateway Working Group is to develop and provide standard and secure interfaces between AllJoyn applications and devices in a proximal network and external protocols, networks and services. 

==== Objectives ====

  * Provide standard ways to connect AllJoyn proximal networking applications and interfaces with external protocols and services
  * Retain and enhance AllJoyn's proximal network privacy and security benefits
  * Enable easy traffic management for high performance and efficient networking and services for AllJoyn applications and devices

==== Scope of Projects in Gateway Working Group ====

  * Remote application connectivity
  * Protocol connectors with other Personal Area Network (PAN) protocols
  * Protocol connectors for interoperability with external network segments, protocols and cloud services connectors
  * Telemetry interfaces
  * Update service interfaces

===== Projects in the Gateway Working Group =====

  * [[gateway:gatewayagent|Gateway Agent Project]] - Provides a standard AllJoyn routing interface local applications/devices and external networks / protocols. These interfaces are supported with a plug-in interface for connectors, including the connector projects in this working group.
  * [[gateway:xmppconn|XMPP Connector Project]] - A Connector that provides end to end AllJoyn applications and services based on the XMPP standard communications protocol
  * [[:mqtt|MQTT Connector Project]] - A Connector that provides end to end AllJoyn applications and services using MQTT
  * [[gateway:sip|SIP End2End Connector Project]] - A Connector that provides end to end AllJoyn applications and services based on the SIP telecommunications protocol
  * [[:u|U+ Connector Project]] - A Connector that provides for interoperation between AllJoyn applications and the U+ protocol
  * [[gateway:dsb|Device System Bridge]] - The DSB is provided for Windows platform and adds support for  existing device automation interfaces (Z-wave, BACnet, ZigBee) and creates a virtual proxy of these devices on the AllJoyn bus. With DSB enabled, AllJoyn devices and non-AllJoyn devices can now interoperate seamlessly.
  * [[gateway:HDB|Home Device Bridge Project]] - A platform portable device bridge supporting for non-AllJoyn devices (such as ZigBee, Z-wave or other automation protocols) to become virtual AllJoyn device/applications.


=== Archived projects ===

The followed project was archived with no current committers.

  * [[gateway:update_service|Update Service Project]] - A project to provide update services for AllJoyn applications.
  * [[analytics-telemetry:overview|Analytics Connector Project (Archived)]] - This project defines AllJoyn interfaces that provide device manufacturers a common API for capturing events, state, and other information, to be collected and transmitted outside the AllJoyn proximal network.

===== Document Process for WGs creating Service Frameworks =====

The TSC formally approved (April 8, 2014) the following document process for all working groups. This process puts certain requirements on all WGs to provide support for compliance and certification. The Committer or Contributor of Core (About...) and each Service Framework (Config, Control Panel, Notifications, Onboarding, Lighting, etc...) MUST Provide to C&C WG:

  * Interface Definitions docs associated with the Core Interfaces or Service Framework Interfaces. (see the Interface Design Guidelines page) [[https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/irb/interface_design_guidelines]]
  * Test Case Specs which are written against the Interface Definition docs (Test Specs template available at [[https://allseen.causewaynow.com/wg/CC_WG/document/183|Test Specs Template]])
  * Provide Test Code implementing the Test Case Specs 
  * Please send documents to the [[allseen-cc@lists.allseenalliance.org|Compliance and Certification (Technical) mail list]].
  * Allow at least 2 weeks lead time for C&C WG to approve documents 
  * Documents MUST be approved by C&C WG BEFORE a product can be certified
 

===== Versioning =====
Version Numbering//
The recent release process change (https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/_media/tsc/allseenalliance-tscminutes09.16.14.pdf) allows service projects to have multiple feature releases per core release. AllJoyn needs a versioning scheme that captures://
  * Core dependency: <core-year>.<core-month>, e.g. 14.06
  * Feature release level: For use by services with more than one feature release built on the same core version
  * Bug fix: versions not affecting incompatibility and certification

We will now append a letter for bug fix releases:
<core-year>.<core-month>.<feature><bugfix-letter>
Examples:
  * 14.06.00 is an initial service release using core 14.06
  * 14.06.00a is a bug fix release
  * 14.06.00b is another bug fix release
  * 14.06.01 is the next service feature release using core 14.06 

As before, bug fix releases cannot add features, modify APIs, or introduce incompatible behavior. They are only intended to address critical stability and security issues.

The AllJoyn core will only add features on major releases 14.12, 15.04, etc. 

Documentation should follow this same versioning, including
  * 14.06 Update1, Update2, etc is used when errors are found or clarifications are made

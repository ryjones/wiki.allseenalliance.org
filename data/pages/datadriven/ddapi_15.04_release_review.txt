===== Known Issues =====

==== Core ====

Running the DDAPI under stress conditions can cause deadlocks, timeouts and segmentation faults. These issues have been investigated and are caused by the following underlying Core issues:

  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1786|ASACORE-1786: Potential deadlock due to NullEndpoint]]
  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1967|ASACORE-1967: Deadlock in PBO PropertiesChanged handler code]]
  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1979|ASACORE-1979: No reply is sent to request when failed to generate a reply message]]
  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1992|ASACORE-1992: DDAPI stress test triggers message timeout when using AllJoyn daemon]]

==== DDAPI ====

The following issues are part of the DDAPI implementation itself:

  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1976|ASACORE-1976: DDAPI unit_test/PropertiesTest.cc sometimes segfaults due late clean-up of previous test]]
      * This is an issue in the implementation of the tests for the DDAPI, and should not affect any user of the DDAPI.
  * [[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1981|ASACORE-1981: DDAPI deadlocks when simultaneously unregistering and registering observers]]

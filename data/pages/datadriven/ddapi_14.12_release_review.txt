====== (Data_driven API) 14.12 Release Review ======

The Data-driven API (DDAPI) for AllJoyn is an alternative API for the AllJoyn framework that is specifically tailored to use cases for the Internet of Things.

For more information on the DDAPI, consult the DDAPI User Documentation on the AllSeen Alliance Website: https://allseenalliance.org/developers
===== Features =====

This is an initial release. Read the documentation for a description of all features.

===== Non-Code Aspects =====

The DDAPI documentation is included in the source repository
    * use doxygen (''tools/Doxyfile'') to generate the API reference manual
    * ''README.md'', included in the source tarball and repository provides information on how to build the DDAPI. 

For information on how to use the DDAPI in your own applications, read the documentation on the AllSeen Alliance website: https://allseenalliance.org/developers/develop.

DDAPI Release 14.12 is dependent on Code Generator Release 14.12.




===== Quality Assurance =====

**Test Coverage**

A range of automated unit tests has been performed with a coverage of 90.3%. 

**Scalability and Stress Tests**

Scalability/stress tests were performed with the following results:

|**C**|**P**|**O**|**T**|
|10|2|100|3.8|
|20|2|100|11.5|
|30|2|100|22.5|
|40|2|100|40.0|
|2|10|100|3.8|
|2|20|100|8.0|
|2|30|100|12.0|
|2|40|100|18.0|
|20|3|100|16.0|
|20|4|100|19.0|

C = number of consumers, P = number of providers, O = number of objects per provider, T = number of seconds to complete the test.

Total number of method invocations and signals is the product of C, P and O.  For the table above it ranges from 2000 to 8000.

Unit tests were validated on Linux Ubuntu 12.04 VVC version 4.6.3 (64 bit). Basic building  and running tests were also performed on //OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment// and //OpenWRT Barrier Breaker//.
===== Known Issues =====

__**ASACORE-1238: Autopinger includes private headers**__

When building the DDAPI on top of AllSeen Core 14.12, the following error will occur:

''(...)/alljoyn-14.12.00-src/build/linux/x86_64/debug/dist/cpp/inc/alljoyn/AutoPinger.h:31:23: fatal error: qcc/Timer.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.''

**Workaround:**
The DDAPI delivery contains a directory //patches//. From the root directory, run the patch:
''patch -Np1 -i ../alljoyn-ddapi-0.0.1-src/data/datadriven_api/patches/alljoyn_core_14.12_autopinger.patch''

This will patch the necessary files:

  * alljoyn_core/inc/alljoyn/AutoPinger.h
  * alljoyn_core/src/AutoPinger.cc
  * alljoyn_core/src/AutoPingerInternal.cc
  * alljoyn_core/src/AutoPingerInternal.h
  * alljoyn_core/unit_test/AutoPingerTest.cc

This issue is solved in Allseen Core Version 14.12a

__**ASADATA-1 Multi-Peer Stress testing Issue**__

Under extreme load some method calls & signals may be lost. This issue is under investigation.

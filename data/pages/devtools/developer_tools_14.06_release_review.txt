The 14.06 code generator release was originally expected to be about a month after the core (standard and thin) release in June 2014. The core release was delayed until early August 2014, and completion of the Android feature also delayed the release of this project. By October, the working group decided to make the Android feature experimental due to the additional unsupported data types relative to the thin library feature. The release was tagged as v14.06 on 03-November-2014.

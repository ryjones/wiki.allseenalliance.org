====== Repo Manifest Proposal ======


----
**The TSC voted to create this repository on {{:tsc:allseen_alliance_-_tsc_minutes_02.03.14.pdf|03 Feb 2014 }}**
----


We would like to publish xml manifests for use by the [[https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/ | repo]] tool, to make it easier to check out a complete AllSeen Alliance workspace.

This project does not involve any code.

===== Requirements =====

  * Publish a manifest that allows developers to quickly check out all master branches
  * Publish manifests that allow developers to quickly check out a specific release branch across all git repositories
  * Publish and tag a versioned manifest for each AllSeen Alliance release.

===== Resources =====

These manifests are maintained along with the current git version control system. They are fairly simple to create and fit in well with current processes to manage the git repositories.

New projects will be added to the manifests as they are created.

===== Committers =====

Existing developer tools committers will be responsible for this project. Mathew Martineau will be the maintainer.

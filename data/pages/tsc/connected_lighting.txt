====== Connected Lighting Project ======

The Connected Lighting Project develops the Lighting Service Framework (LSF) providing an open and common way of communicating with AllJoyn-based connected lighting products, regardless of manufacturer. This will enable lighting manufacturers to make their products interoperable with each other as well as other connected things, and provide 3rd party application developers with a common interface (API) to communicate with lights across manufacturers.

Examples of features of LSF include the ability to group lamps together and control their hue, saturation, brightness, and color temperature to match a users preference or mood. Other features include the ability to personalize the lighting experience to an individuals tastes and preferences by setting lighting Scenes, and the ability for users to add lighting Effects like pulsing lights for notifications purposes.

====== LSF Architecture ======

The LSF is a multi-tier architecture with components that reside inside and outside the Lamp (light bulb), and will run over any IP bearer capable of running AllJoyn. Components include:
  - Lamp Service
  - Lighting Controller Service
  - Sample Applications for Android and iOS
  - Lighting SDK beta for Android (and iOS, see [[https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/tsc/connected_lighting?&#roadmap|Roadmap)]]

==== 1. Lamp Service ====

The Lamp Service is implemented by the Lamp (light bulb) Manufacturer inside the connected Lamp firmware to make the Lamp LSF compatible.  The Lamp Service is designed to run in a very small footprint (1KB SRAM/5KB Flash) on an embedded RTOS in the Lamps Microcontroller (MCU), and works in conjunction and is dependent on the AllJoyn Thin Client [[https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/ajtcl.git | ajtcl]] and [[https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/services/base_tcl.git/ | base_tcl]].  If you are building lamp hardware and want to make it compatible with the Lighting Service Framework and certified "Designed for AllSeen", you will need to implement the Lamp Service in your Lamp and pass the Lamp Service tests included in the certification tool.

Who should implement the Lamp Service?
  -  Lamp Manufacturers building IP connected Lamps
==== 2. Lighting Controller Service ====

The Lighting Controller Service is a mandatory component of the LSF and works in conjunction with and is dependent on the [[https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/alljoyn.git/tree/alljoyn_core | AllJoyn Core Standard Client and Router]]. It stores group, scene, and preset information and discovers and connects with devices on the same network running Lamp Service.  If multiple Lighting Controller Services are running on the same network, they arbitrate and one becomes a Leader and the rest become Followers. Group, Scene, and Preset information is synchronized between Leaders and Followers, and if a Leader leaves the network a Follower will be promoted and take over controlling the Lamps. Lighting Controller Service runs outside of the Lamp on a Hub, Router, Switch, Gateway, or any other Linux-based device (such as [[https://openwrt.org/ | OpenWrt)]] on the same network as the Lamps. It can also be bundled in with the mobile application running on an Android or iOS Smartphone or Tablet that the end user uses to discover and control the Lamps. The Lighting Controller Service footprint is roughly 270KB Flash / 25KB RAM not including the AllJoyn Core.

__Lighting Controller Support for AllJoyn Events & Actions__

A significant and powerful feature of the Lighting Controller Service is that it exposes every Scene as an [[https://allseenalliance.org/docs-and-downloads/documentation/guide-using-alljoyn-events-and-actions-feature | AllJoyn Event & Action]]. Events and Actions are loosely coupled integrations that enable just in time interoperability.  
  * **Actions** allow Scenes in the Lighting Controller to be discovered, introspected, and invoked dynamically by other devices and applications. This makes it very easy for other devices to trigger a Scene. The Lighting Controller automatically exposes every Scene as an action with a text descriptor that includes the Scene name.  Create a new Scene and that Scene is instantly discoverable and invokable as an AllJoyn Action.   
  * **Events** allow Scenes in the Lighting Controller to notify other devices and applications when a Scene is applied, allowing other devices to react when they receive the Scene's Event. The Lighting Controller automatically triggers an Event whenever a Scene is invoked.  The Event is discoverable with a text descriptor that includes the Scene name.  Create a new Scene and that Scene is instantly discoverable and will emit an Event when the Scene is applied.

Actions are an extremely powerful way of integrating IoT products using AllJoyn. For example, a Hub, Gateway, or Router running the Lighting Controller can host a rules engine to discover all devices on the network emitting Events (Including the Lighting Controller itself) and allow the consumer to create rules that bind those events to Lighting Scenes exposed as Actions.  This can (for example), allow the door lock to launch a "Welcome Home" scene when the door is unlocked or allow the wearable baby monitor to pulse the lights when the baby is waking up. All of this can be accomplished proximally on the local network without the need to go to the cloud.

Who should implement the Lighting Controller Service?
  - Lamp Manufacturers bundling the Lighting Controller in their Hub or Gateway
  - Lamp Manufacturers bundling the Lighting Controller in their iOS or Android Application
  - CE Manufacturers who develop routers, gateways, hubs, or other Connected Devices running Linux who want their products to interoperate with AllJoyn-based lamps out of the box. For example, a CE OEM who builds a Home Automation Controller may elect to implement the Lighting Controller within their hub to make it interoperable with Lamps in the AllJoyn lighting Ecosystem.
  - Connected Device Manufacturers who developer appliances, white or brown goods, or other Connected Devices running Linux who want their products to interoperate with AllJoyn-based lighting out of the box.
  - Application Developers who want their applications to be able to discover and control AllJoyn-based Lamps. 
==== 3. Sample Applications ====

The Sample Applications are turnkey applications for iOS and Android that can be used by a Lamp Manufacturer to jumpstart the development of their own branded AllJoyn LSF-compatible mobile applications.

Who should use the Sample Applications?
  - Lamp Manufacturers who want to developer their own custom branded applications for lighting control
  - Application Developers who want low-level API's for interfacing with the Lighting Controller Service such as creating Scenes, Groups, and Presets.  Application Developers should start with the Lighting SDK, which includes many of the standard functions for interfacing with Lamps using higher level API's that can speed development.
  
  
==== 4. Lighting SDK (beta) ====

The Lighting SDK provides Application Developers with a high level toolset for discovering and manipulating LSF-compatible lamps, allowing them to discover individual or groups of lamps, manipulate their Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, and Brightness and discover and apply Scenes. Starting in v15.04, the Lighting SDK provides a complete set of APIs such as manipulating groups, scenes, and presets.  v15.04 Sample Applications (for both Android and iOS) are completely written using v15.04 Lighting SDK.  These SDKs are also available in [[https://allseenalliance.org/developers/download|Alliance Download]]

Who should use the Lighting SDK?
  * Mobile Application Developers who want to quickly begin interfacing with AllJoyn compatible lamps.
====== Getting Started ======

  - Watch the Overview Presentation on LSF from Uplinq 2014: [[http://youtu.be/3lNzNj5ytqM?list=PLxeazpXYyqtNm2EnCbfSzy7aKOkHjiaSi | Watch via YouTube]] and [[http://www.slideshare.net/QualcommDeveloperNetwork/80-connected-lighting-vogelsangfok919gg45 | View the Presentation]]
  - Download and install the V.14.06 Sample Application for Android on an Android Smartphone (Device 1): [[https://build.allseenalliance.org/lighting/view/v14_06/job/Lighting_Sample_App_Android_v14_06/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/release/LSFSampleApp_Android_01_00_0794_debug.apk | APK Download]]
  - Download and install the Lamp Simulator Application, called Luminaire, from Google Play on another Android Smartphone (Device 2): [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qualcomm.luminaire | Download from Google Play]]
  - Make sure that both the Sample Application running on Device 1 and Luminaire running on Device 2 are both on the same Wi-Fi network. 
  - Launch Luminaire on Device 2 and enable the Lighting Controller via the on/off switch under the Controller tab. 
  - Launch the Sample Application on Device 1.
  - You should now see the virtual lamp in Luminaire from the Sample Application, and can control its properties just like a physical bulb, e.g. control Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, and Brightness and create Presets, Groups, and Scenes that include Effects. Protip: Run multiple instances of Luminaire on separate devices to simulate multiple lamps.
  - Download the [[https://build.allseenalliance.org/lighting/view/v14_06/job/Lighting_SDK_Android_v14_06/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/release/Lighting_SDK_beta_Android_01_00_0325.zip| Lighting SDK 14.06 for Android (Beta):]] which can be used to manipulate the virtual lamp in Luminaire.  
  - Create a Scene with the LSF Sample and Experiment with the Scenes Events and Actions exposed via Luminaire's instance of the Lighting Controller. Events & Actions are powerful ways to interoperate with the LSF.
  - If you're new to Android development, see [[https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/lighting/Building_Android_Sample_with_Lighting_SDK|Building a sample Android app using the AllJoyn Lighting SDK]]
====== Features ======

The Features of the Lighting Service Framework include a common implementation into the open source, which accomplish the following: 

  - Controlling individual state of a Lamp such as On/Off, Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, or Brightness. 
  - Managing Groups of Lamps, including creating, naming, and deleting groups allowing them to be controlled together as if they were a single lamp.
  - Saving lighting preferences called "Presets" allowing a particular state to be named stored for future use. 
  - Applying lighting Effects like pulsing the Lamps or transitioning them to a particular state over time.
  - Creating Lighting Scenes and Master Scenes comprised of Lamps or groups of Lamps and associated preferences and Effects that can be applied to set a mood or ambiance. 

For a complete list of features please see the AllSeen Summit [[https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/_media/tsc/lighting/connectedlighting_allseen_summit_nov_2014_v04.pdf|Presentation]]

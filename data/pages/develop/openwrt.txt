====== OpenWRT ======

AllJoyn feeds exist on the following OpenWRT platform releases:
  * v12.09 - official tagged release
  * Attitude Adjustment - current stable release
  * Barrier breaker - current development version

Follow the below instructions to add AllJoyn to your OpenWRT environment.

===== Patch OpenSSL =====

  * For Attitude Adjustment, use [[https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/attitude_adjustment?rev=39585|39585]] or later, or apply [[http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4802/|patch 4802]] (The 12.09 tagged release requires this patch. The latest version on the Attitude Adjustment branch already has the patch applied.)

  * For Barrier Breaker, use [[https://dev.openwrt.org/browser?rev=39048|39048]] or later, or apply [[http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4576/|patch 4576]] (The latest version of Barrier Breaker, aka trunk, already has the patch applied.)

Note: If you do not need to build Google tests be sure that GTEST_DIR is not defined during the build.

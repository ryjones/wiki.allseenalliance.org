*  Base Services are common services used by many devices, providing a set of interfaces for different devices to interact and interoperate with one another. Onboarding provides a consistent way to bring a new device onto the Wi-Fi network. Configuration allows one to configure certain attributes of an application/device, such as its friendly name. Notification allows text-based notifications to be sent and received by devices on the AllJoyn™ network. Also supports audio and images via URLs. Control Panel allows devices to advertise a virtual control panel to be controlled remotely.

Gateway Agent - https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/gateway/gatewayagent 


*  The gateway agent which provides a standard and secure, remote access method for AllJoyn devices and applications to connect to external/cloud services, PAN technologies, other networks. 
 
Lighting Service Framework - https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/tsc/connected_lighting

*  The LSF is a multi-tier architecture with components that reside inside and outside the Lamp (light bulb), and will run over any IP bearer capable of running AllJoyn. Components include: Lamp Service and Lighting Controller Service

Home Appliances & Entertainment (HAE) Service Framework Project - https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/hae

*  The [HAE service framework project](/hae) develops the common way of controlling and monitoring HAE category devices, regardless of device manufacturers.

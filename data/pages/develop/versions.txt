====== Versioning in AllJoyn ======
Every release of AllJoyn code is made under a version number. The Release Version of AllJoyn code is structured to provide detailed information for implementers.

  * YY.MM is the Major Version of a release. It is named for the year and month of the release. Major Versions include significant new functionality.
  * YY.MM.ff is the Feature Version of a release. A Feature Version enabled new functionality in in interim release.
  * YY.MM.ff.p or YY.MM.p (when the feature version is 00) is the Patch Release. Patch Releases fix critical issues, or addresses security vulnerabilities within a version but contains no new functionality

----

The initial Major Version of a release has the implicit Feature Version of .00 (YY.MM.00) but this can be (and usually is) omitted when referring to that release version. Any time a version of AllJoyn is given as YY.MM or YY.MM.p, the feature version is .00 implied.

Implementers are strongly encouraged to always use the latest version of the AllJoyn code at the Major Version, Feature Version and Patch Release level. 

Details of which specific release Versions of a Base Implementation may be submitted for certification are outlined on the [[https://allseenalliance.org/compliance|Compliance page]].

If a critical security vulnerability is discovered is a specific release version, it may be  identified as invalid for certification. Should this happen it will be clearly identified on the [[https://allseenalliance.org/compliance|Compliance page]].

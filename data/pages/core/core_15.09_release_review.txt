===== Quality Assurance =====

We have a layered approach to testing that starts with verifying core functionality, such as messaging and security. Then, we execute platform-specific tests for each of the platforms listed above. This includes testing of transports, bindings, sample applications, as well as stress testing. We also conduct interoperability testing to ensure that, for example, AllJoyn applications running on a Windows laptop can interact with applications running on an Android phone. Finally, we do backward compatibility testing to ensure, for example, that a new routing node will communicate with an older routing node. 

Issues identified during testing are documented in our bug tracking system. A triage process assigns the bugs a priority and a release target. Naturally, the highest priority bugs are targeted for the next release. Once a bug has been resolved-fixed, then the bug fix is verified, and the bug is closed. 

==== Feature Test ====

Feature test plans were completed for all of the major new features cited in the release notes referenced [[#features_issues_addressed_and_known_issues|above]].

===== Toolchains used to build SDKs ===== 

^SDK^Toolchain Used^
| alljoyn-15.04.00-src.tar.gz| N/a - source|
| ajtcl-15.04.00-src.tar.gz| N/a - source|
| Core SDK - release (android)| Android NDK r10e, Oracle Java 7|
| Core SDK - debug (android)| Android NDK r10e, Oracle Java 7|  

===== Architectural Issues =====
The Security 2.0 feature ([[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1393|ASACORE-1393]]) introduces a whole new model and architecture for enabling security to AllJoyn enable IoT applications/devices.  Details can be found on the [[security_enhancements|Security 2.0 wiki page]].

The ARDP/UDP Transport for TC <-> RN connections ([[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1686|ASACORE-1686]]) allows AllJoyn TC applications to connect to the routing node using the ARDP protocol which is less resource intensive on the routing node than using TCP, thus allowing for a larger number of connections.  This has be made the default transport for TC applications; however, fall-back to TCP will happen should the ARPD connection fail to be established.

===== Security Issues =====

==== Feature Test ====

Feature test plans were completed for all of the major new features cited above.

==== Regression Test ====

AllJoyn Standard Library was tested successfully on the following:

  * Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64 bit)
  * Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 (ARM)
  * Android JellyBean 4.1 (ARM)
  * Android Kit Kat 4.4 (ARM)
  * Windows 7/8/8.1 (64 bit)
  * Windows 10 Technical Preview (64 bit)
  * iOS 7.1 (32-bit)
  * OSX 10.9 Lion
  * OpenWRT BB and CC branches

AllJoyn Thin Library was tested successfully on the following:

  * Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64 bit)
  * Windows 7/8/8.1 (64 bit)
  * ARM-based embedded platform

We have a layered approach to testing that starts with verifying core functionality, such as messaging and security. Then, we execute platform-specific tests for each of the platforms listed above. This includes testing of transports, bindings, sample applications, as well as stress testing. We also conduct interoperability testing to ensure that, for example, AllJoyn applications running on a Windows laptop can interact with applications running on an Android phone. Finally, we do backward compatibility testing to ensure, for example, that a new routing node will communicate with an older routing node. 

Issues identified during testing are documented in our bug tracking system. A triage process assigns the bugs a priority and a release target. Naturally, the highest priority bugs are targeted for the next release. Once a bug has been resolved-fixed, then the bug fix is verified, and the bug is closed.

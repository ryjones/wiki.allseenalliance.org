===== Quality Assurance =====

We have a layered approach to testing that starts with verifying core functionality, such as messaging and security. Then, we execute platform-specific tests for each of the platforms listed above. This includes testing of transports, bindings, sample applications, as well as stress testing. We also conduct interoperability testing to ensure that, for example, AllJoyn applications running on a Windows laptop can interact with applications running on an Android phone. Finally, we do backward compatibility testing to ensure, for example, that a new routing node will communicate with an older routing node. 

Issues identified during testing are documented in our bug tracking system. A triage process assigns the bugs a priority and a release target. Naturally, the highest priority bugs are targeted for the next release. Once a bug has been resolved-fixed, then the bug fix is verified, and the bug is closed.

===== Architectural Issues =====
None

===== Security Issues =====
[[Security Enhancements]] ([[https://jira.allseenalliance.org/browse/ASACORE-1393|ASACORE-1393]])
 feature is officially released!

===== Compatibility =====
**SCL **
  * Security 2.0 developer and wire APIs have changed from the Developer Previewversions in 15.09 and 16.04
  * ASACORE-3353: Codegen'ed apps cannot interop with non-apps. An application that introspects and finds multiple annotations that are dependent on ordering (e.g., org.allJoyn.Bus.Struct.*) based on AllJoyn 16.04 should treat these annotations as unusable. To determine the AllJoyn framework version, an application can query the About data. This was fixed in 16.10.


**TCL**
  * Security 2.0 developer and wire APIs have changed from the Developer Previewversions in 15.09 and 16.04

===== End-of-life =====
N/A

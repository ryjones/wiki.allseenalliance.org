# Analytics Connector Project (Archived)

This project is tasked with defining AllJoyn interfaces that provide device manufacturers a common API for capturing events, state, and other information, to be collected and transmitted outside the AllJoyn proximal network. This data can then be used to derive information that will benefit device manufacturers and consumers alike.
